# Bayesian optimization in amyloids prediction
The repository contains the codes needed to reproduce all the results presented in master thesis 'Bayesian optimization in prediction of amyloid proteins' written at the Warsaw University of Technology under the direction of Michał Burdukiewicz, PhD. 

The most important outcome is AmyloGram model tuned using Bayesian optimization method. AmyloGram is random forest-based model for prediction of amyloid proteins. It was described in the article: [Burdukiewicz M, Sobczyk P, Rödiger S, Duda-Madej A, Mackiewicz P, Kotulska M. (2017) Amyloidogenic motifs revealed by n-gram analysis (Scientific Reports 7 (1), 12961)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13210-9) and is available as a R package and on a website www.smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/shiny/AmyloGram/.
